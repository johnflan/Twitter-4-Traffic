At present, our group has achieved great progress. In the server part of project,  mock server has been built for testing JASON file transmission between server and mobile client. Naive Bayes is being implemented for Tweet Classifier in which tweets can be imported and judged wheather it is about traffic. However more works should be done to improve the accurancy of this classifier. In order to train the classifier with supervides learning, labelling script is created for sorting tweets manually into four groups: traffice/non-traffice/unclear/robot. Because there are over 500 thousands tweets received, it will take more time to finish labelling all tweets. Routes for specific users will be stored in remote database in the future. Meanwhile, data backup for database has been added to avoid unexpected situation. In terms of mobile client, GUIs for event list and framework have been added in Android application. Getting geolocation, contacting server to retrieve JASON file and displaying disruptions in a list have been finished at present. Hash tag about T4T can be added for users to send tweets to Twitter. The demo version will be released soon.
