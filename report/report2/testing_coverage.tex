To date, much of the server side code has been experimental, mainly consisting
of identifying clusters of tweets and classifying vehicular traffic tweets. Due
to this we don't have much test coverage of this code. We are now beginning to
build the server service from these algorithms, unit and functional test
coverage is an important part of this development. Currently we have a set of
cURL scripts to perform functional testing against the server interface.

In addition to code coverage we are statistically assessing the classifier. The
below results are achieved by dividing the labelled set into training and
testing sets. The results for the accuracy are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Accuracy for train set: 99.84\%
\item Accuracy for test set:  77.37\%
\end{itemize}

The testing progress has been much more successful with the development of the
Android mobile application due to its less experimental nature. The mobile
application has been written to minimise internal dependencies in order to
maximise the ability to exercise those classes. One area of difficulty in
testing this mobile application has been trying to test classes that extend
system classes. To avoid this problem, we are striving to only perform `wiring'
and instantiation in those classes.
