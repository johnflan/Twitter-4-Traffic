City planners have been struggling to acquire real-time data on traffic
conditions. This data is especially important with incidents which may
translate into traffic disruptions on an already over capacity road network.
Cities have experimented with traffic cameras, dynamic traffic light control
and more traditionally traffic based radio stations.

Internet connected mobile phones and micro-blogging platforms like Twitter have
been providing researchers with a vast and interesting source of real-world
data. This data has been used to analyse trends, identify concepts and to
augment traditional curated data providing a level of social knowledge to the
topic.

Twitter for traffic aims to take these concepts to provide the mobile user with
an application for assessing traffic disruptions as they evolve for London
city. To provide this insight, the application will present the user with
curated traffic disruptions augmented with social knowledge of the event
harvested from a social network.  In addition to this curated list of traffic
disruptions, the concept of identifying emerging disruptions from this social
data will be explored, with the aim of identifying clusters of disruption
reports to discover new disruption events.

To promote the of reporting the traffic conditions on a social network, it will
also be necessary to provide a fast, simple and descriptive mechanism for the
user to manually contribute their observations.

There are a number of interesting challenges the comprise this task. Initially
we must identify tweets from Twitter that discuss road traffic. For these
traffic tweets to be of value we must be able to infer some geographic location
for each tweet, a small percentage of tweets actually contain a geographic
    location so other methods must be explored. To identify events from tweets
    alone, we must investigate geographic clusters of tweets which discuss
    traffic. There are a number of problems in detecting valid traffic
    effecting events, these include sufficient data, timeliness of the tweets
    and  ‘normal’ levels of background chatter.

    From the onset there are many unknowns relating to the data analysis,
    including the quantity of traffic related messages and quality of the
    content. Aspects of this project include data mining, social network
    analysis, mobile application development, document classification and
    geographical information systems.
