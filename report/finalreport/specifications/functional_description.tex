The team is tasked with creating a system that mines social data and curated
traffic information provided from Transport for London, in order to provide
insight into the current state of road traffic.

This system should mine and identify tweets that discuss road traffic for a
particular region. Initially these tweets should be correlated with the TfL
traffic disruptions, but to capture new and evolving events, the inferencing of
traffic disruptions from tweets alone should be investigated.

Practically there should be a user interface to the system that enables the
user to view a list of disruptions each with a useful additional information
and the social conversation surrounding the disruption.
