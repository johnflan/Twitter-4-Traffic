\subsection{Achieved goals and difficulties}
The specifications and which of them were implemented or not is described in
Section 2. The reasons some features were not included in the final project is
that there were some difficulties that could not be overcome.
The difficulties that were met are described below:

\emph{Identify traffic disruptions from Twitter}

The reason that this feature could not be included is that the traffic tweets
for a small timeslice are too few to get results from the clustering described
in Section 7.1. The feature is still implemented, but the data used to test
were in a timeslice of an hour and using data that were not specifically about
traffic. This means that a new cluster we may find might also indicate an
event that is irrelevant to traffic. Nonetheless, this should prove very useful
in the future.

\emph{Enhance clustering algorithm}

This feature could not be included in the product of this project because we
could not implement clustering to work in real time, as described in the
previous feature that was not implemented.

\emph{Present tweets on the map}

\emph{Other difficulties}
