At the early stages of the project, all areas were investigated to determine their feasibility and to estimate the amount of work which should be done. Each team member did research on a different part of the specification in order to establish how many steps need to be taken to get the goal and how long. The group then discussed which team member would be responsible for different tasks. Every team member is expected to contribute at least 10 hours per week on this group project.The initial arrangement was listed below, shown as a table.\\
