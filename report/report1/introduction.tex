Twitter for traffic aims to provide the mobile user with an application for assessing traffic disruptions as they evolve. To provide this insight, the application will present the user with curated traffic disruptions augmented with social knowledge of the event harvested from a social network. In addition to this curated list of traffic disruptions, Twitter for traffic will also extract clusters of disruption reports from social networks to identify new disruptions.

To successfully achieve the project goals, the development will encompass an understanding from many areas of computer science. Aspects of this project include data mining, social network analysis, mobile application development, document classification and geographical information systems. Analysing the social and curated datafeeds to identify new disruption events will be a particularly interesting undertaking. From the onset there are many unknowns relating to the data analysis, relating to the quantity of traffic related messages and quality of the content.
