Twitter for traffic aims to provide the mobile user with an application for
assessing traffic disruptions as they evolve. To provide this insight, the
application will present the user with curated traffic disruptions augmented
with social knowledge of the event harvested from a social network. In addition
to this curated list of traffic disruptions, the application will also identify
clusters of disruption reports from social networks to discover new disruption events.

Aspects of this project include data mining, social network analysis, mobile
application development, document classification and geographical information
systems. Analysing the social and curated data feeds to identify new disruption
events will be a particularly interesting undertaking. From the onset there are
many unknowns relating to the data analysis, including the quantity of traffic related messages and quality of the content.
