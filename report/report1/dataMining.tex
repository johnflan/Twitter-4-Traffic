In order to retrieve traffic disruptions from social data, several techniques are under consideration. Classifying the tweets would first require the extraction of the relevant features. The classification methods that are considered include Decision Trees with selected keywords or the Naive Bayes model which is probabilistic. A different approach is to implement methods with Neural Networks, including k-Nearest Neighbours and Support Vector Machine. The latter method is expected to extract better results. In long term, using Neural Networks can be better, because of their dynamic nature. That means that they can be improved over time, while the other techniques are static.
