The project will consist of two separate development efforts, a
hosted application to source and correlate data and a mobile application to
display events and report disruptions. In order to describe the system, the
requirements will be identified using goal-oriented capture\cite{Requirements}.

The hosted application will retrieve traffic events from a Transport for London
(TfL)\cite{website:tfl_dev} data feed and a Twitter
feed\cite{website:twitter_dev} perodically. TfL provides a curated feed of
ongoing traffic disruptions in a structured format. Twitter provides us with a
torrent of unsorted tweets, from which relevant tweets must be extracted. 
Additionally, traffic disruptions reported from the mobile application can be
identified through the use of an identifier, enabling those messages to be
processed separately. To discover tweets that discuss traffic concepts,
document classification techniques will be utilised. As the message
classification algorithm improves, it is expected to be able to generate 
traffic disruptions that are reported only from Twitter, and not yet on TfL.

The mobile application must provide the commuter with a mechanism for discovering disruptions that may affect their route. This is to be provided through the use of a map based interface. The mobile application also must offer the user the ability to comment or describe an on going traffic disruption. The user interface for reporting disruptions must offer a quick and intuitive mechanism for describing a particular event, while also satisfying users that require more control over the messages published on their account.

The table below shows a breakdown of features ordered by their priority, feasibility and expected completion date. The smaller number in priority means more important to finish fast and in feasibility the smaller number means more achievable.
