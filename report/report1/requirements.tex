Twitter for traffic aims to provide the mobile user with an application for assessing traffic disruptions as they evolve. To provide this insight, the application will present the user with curated traffic disruptions augmented with social knowledge of the event harvested from a social network.

The project will consist of two separate development efforts, consisting of a hosted application to source and correlate data and a mobile application to display events and report disruptions. In order to describe the system, the requirements were identified with goal-oriented capture\cite{Requirements}.

The hosted application will retrieve traffic events from a Transport for London (TfL) data feed and correlate each event with relevant tweets harvested from Twitter. The server based application gathers data from TfL and Twitter periodically. TfL provides a curated feed of ongoing traffic disruptions in a structured format. Twitter provides us with a torrent of unsorted tweets, from which relevant tweets must be extracted. In addition traffic disruptions reported from the mobile application can be identified through the use of a hash tag, enabling these messages to be processed separately. The server gathers the TfL data and then tries to match tweets about these traffic disruptions. To discover tweets that discuss traffic concepts, document classification techniques must be utilised. Two points we can improve on the server is the classification algorithm, and adding the functionality to generate traffic disruptions that are reported only from Twitter, and not yet on TfL.

The mobile application must provide the commuter with a mechanism for discovering disruptions that may affect their route. This is to be provided through the use of a map based interface. In addition the mobile application must offer the user the ability to comment or describe an on going traffic disruption. The user interface for reporting disruptions must offer a quick and intuitive mechanism for describing a particular event, while also satisfying users that require more control over the messages published on their account.

Below there are tables for every feature and its priority, feasibility and expected completion date. The smaller number in priority means more important to finish fast (1-10) and in feasibility the smaller number means more achievable (1-10).
